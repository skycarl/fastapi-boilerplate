# ⚒️ Techologies Used

- Pydantic: For Typing or Serialization.
- Pytests: For TDD or Unit Testing.
- Poetry: Python dependency management and packaging made easy. (Better than pip)
- Docker & docker-compose : For Virtualization.
- postgresSQL: Database.
- PgAdmin: To interact with the Postgres database sessions.
- Loguru: Easiest logging ever done.
- Pydantic Settings: Type-safe environment variable management with automatic validation.

# 🚀 Setup 🕙
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed [docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Configuration
This project uses **pydantic-settings** for environment variable management for type safety and validation.

## Step 1
Create **.env** file in root folder fastapi-boilerplate/.env

The application settings are managed by `app/core/settings.py` which uses Pydantic BaseSettings for type-safe configuration.

```

# 🧹 Running Pre-commit Hooks Manually

To manually run pre-commit hooks:

1. Install the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```
2. Run all pre-commit hooks on all files:
   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

You can also run specific hooks or run them only on staged files. See the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) for more options.
